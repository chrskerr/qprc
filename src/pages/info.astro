  <h2>Contact</h2>

  <p>
    Please feel free to get in touch with for any questions, comments, etc. The
    easiest approach is one of the following two ways:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIGlqYGaisbj7IpkudO8s9suHA4-nUW0rv6sfgH51TWUzEhAyF6Zzd6Bc-861TpbwTt8z"
        >Join our QPRC Signal group chat</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Show up at one of the runs. Newbies are always welcome and we add new
      events to this site manually, so if it's in the upcoming runs list then
      someone will be there!
    </li>
  </ol>
