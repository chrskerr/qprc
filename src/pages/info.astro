  <h2>Contact</h2>

  <p>
    Please feel free to get in touch with us for any questions, thoughts or feedback. The
    easiest approach is one of the following two ways:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIGlqYGaisbj7IpkudO8s9suHA4-nUW0rv6sfgH51TWUzEhAyF6Zzd6Bc-861TpbwTt8z"
        >Join our QPRC Signal group chat</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Show up at one of the runs. Newbies are always welcome and we add new
      events to this site manually, so if it's in the upcoming runs list then
      someone will be there!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Questions</h2>

  <Accordion
    question="Who organises QPRC and why?"
    answer={[
      "We (Kate and Chris) wanted to bring people together in the Maroochydore area, around staying active and having a laugh. As keen runners ourselves, we'd noticed there was a gap in the area for a free running group that provides a structured session each week."
    ]}
  />
  <Accordion
    question="How does the run session work? And how does it cater for all abilities?"
    answer="The full session will take about 1 hour. Heading off at 5.30pm, we will jog together as a group to the starting point of the main session. From there Kate or Chris will explain the session that day and we run time based intervals for about 20-25 minutes. This means that the faster runners will run more intervals and cover more distance than the slower runners, allowing everyone to get a great run, at any level of fitness! We'll then regroup and jog back to the starting point by 6.30pm at the latest."
  />
  <Accordion
  question="Is there a minimal level of fitness required?"
  answer="No! You can walk as much as needed at anypoint during the run. If you're still not sure, then please reach out to us with any questions."
