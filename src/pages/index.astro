      <p class="mt-0">Hey friends!</p>

      <p>
        Come join us for a run, chat and drink every Wednesday afternoon around
        the Maroochydore/Alexandra Headlands area.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole session takes about 1 hour, with 20-25 minutes of hard work in
        the middle. The warm-up and cooldown will cover 2-3km, and the core will
        vary with your speed, but you can do as much or as little as you like.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's always planned in way that ensures everyone gets in a great session
        no matter your level of fitness and speediness!
      </p>

      <p>The typical structure is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usually Wednesdays, usually 5:30pm, always near Maroochydore.</li>
        <li>
          We meet somewhere near both a nice running spot and a venue for those
          keen after the run.
        </li>
        <li>Start with a warmup as a group, 1-2km.</li>
        <li>
          Then 20-25 minutes of running intervals at everyones individual pace,
          <ul class="list-[lower-roman]">
            <li>e.g. run hard to that tree, walk back to this tree, repeat.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, we jog together back to the start as a cooldown.</li>
        <li>Optionally stick around for a drink!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Check out the upcoming runs for exact locations and reach out to Kate or
        Chris if you have any questions. No cost to join!
      </p>

      <p>
        We are all about having fun and not taking ourselves too seriously. We'd
        love to see you for a run soon!
      </p>
